→ It's totaly in test mode on my Phlt m8 brd
→ In use:
	V-USB, WARNING - not standard Pins are being used for Interrupt and Data
	ADC (10 bit) TODO check if maybe free running might be a bit better
	Will be PWM
→ ADC is connected like that: Vcc → divider (100k epcos NTC / (100k epcos NTC + 1kR) )
	it will be better ilustrated when I make a special brd just for that controller
→ It remembering that it shall be easy to port to any V-USB device
→ It would be great to port to the cheapest stm32 with USB, although I have no 
	succes in moving USB any stm32. Than it would be possible to avoid temp_find
	and temp_to_send functions on PC, and raw temperature would be send on USB bus
	instead. (It would be more acurate too). Now it's not like that due to AVR 
	calculating power (which I do not want to test too much :) )
