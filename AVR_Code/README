→ In use:
	V-USB, WARNING - not standard Pins are being used for Interrupt and Data
	ADC (10 bit) TODO check if maybe free running might be a bit better
	Will be PWM
→ ADC is connected like that: Vcc → divider (100k epcos NTC / (100k epcos NTC + 1kR) )
	it will be better ilustrated when I make a special brd just for that controller
→ its connected to ADC5
