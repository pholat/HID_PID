HID_PID
=======

PID controller based on VUSB device

→ Right now it works with written into Qt temperature curve in bistate mode. PID and choice between temp curve / constatn temperature / only measure ment is to be done yet.

→ It's goal it to create usable, minimal PID controller and soft needed to calibrate PID values

→ Mesure ments are usable now, tested only on old chineese pecos clone. Yet to be tested PID controll.

→ It's dedicated for heat controll purposes

→ Electronics design will be posted in meantime


To compile
=======
 You will need:
 
 → Qt5
 
 → Qwt
 
 
Final thoughts
=======
It's written for linux, but there shall be no problem to port it to windows.
I don't take any responsibility for how you use it.
