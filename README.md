HID_PID
=======

PID controller based on VUSB device

→ It's not usable yet - data exchange has to be finished

→ It's goal it to create usable, minimal PID controller and soft needed to calibrate PID values

→ It's dedicated for heat controll purposes

→ Electronics design will be posted in meantime


To compile
=======
 You will need:
 
 → Qt5
 
 → Qwt
 
 
Final thoughts
=======
It's written for linux, but there shall be no problem to port it to windows.
I don't take any responsibility for how you use it.
